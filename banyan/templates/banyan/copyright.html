			<strong>Trademark Violation</strong>
			Trademark violations may involve using a company or business name, logo, or other trademark-protected materials in a manner that may mislead or confuse others with regard to its brand or business affiliation.
			Using another's trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a violation of Banyanâ€™s trademark policy. Note that Banyan usernames are provided on a first-come, first-served basis and may not be reserved.
			If an account is impersonating or violating the trademark of your brand, use our contact form or email us at copyright@seesaw.co in order to report the account and we will take a closer look. Please submit requests from your company email address and provide all of the following information:

				<li>Your first and last name</li>
				<li>Title</li>
				<li>Address</li>
